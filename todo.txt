variables -a 

expressions - 3 + a
assigments - 3 = 3
            3 + b
boolean - a = 3 boolean operators, ==, =>, <=, <, > !=
conditions -> if boolean then sequence endif
whileloops -> while boolean do sequence endif
sequence -> expression+

FORTH:
VARIABLE your-var # assigns address for storing value

Source: a = c + 2
Target: c @ 2 + a !
